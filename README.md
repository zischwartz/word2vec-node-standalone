A dumb fix to a dumb problem.

This package simply contains a slightly modified version of the vector data from [GloVe](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/GloVe), [node-word2vec](https://github.com/Planeshifter/node-word2vec) to load that data into a model, and, as a bonus, a couple of word lists by frequency from [here](https://github.com/first20hours/google-10000-english/).

This package is huge, `glove.6B.50d1.txt` alone is over 170 MB uncompressed.
